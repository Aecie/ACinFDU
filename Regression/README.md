Regression Problem

In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The basic task of regression problem is to find parameters that define a line in 2D dimention (or a hyperplane in higher dimention) to fit a group of discrete spatial points (spatial samples). The outcome of predict computing in regression possesses continuous.
